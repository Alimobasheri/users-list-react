# Front-end developer challenge
The aim of the implementation is not to complete the assignment (of course this would be great), but rather to find out more about your approach, the quality,
cleanliness and structure of your code, and get to know your personal prioritization. This means that it’s better if send an unfinished app with code you can be proud
of, rather than a complete app with lots of messy code. Mockups in this task are just a design suggestion – you are free to implement any other design as soon as it
looks OK and meets the requirements.
